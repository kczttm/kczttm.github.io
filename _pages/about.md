Welcome! I'm a Robotics PhD student working with Prof. [Shreyas Kousik](https://www.shreyaskousik.com){:target="_blank"} in the Safe Robotics Lab at Gatech. I'm interested in robot manipulations in the area of ordinary home tasks such as cooking and cleaning. These tasks are challenging due to uncertainties that sometimes require a sense of touch on top of the commonly used vision. 

While one can always design specialized tools for each individual task, such a short cut might defeat the initial purpose of robot arm as a "general purpose machine" (according to the patent of the first robot arm - [Unimate](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/6a/78/93/6b7927856c9bee/US2988237.pdf){:target="_blank"}). During my time as a PhD student, I hope to solve problems in this area by providing both software and hardware solutions.    

Prior to joining Georgia Tech, I studied at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute where I obtained B.S. Mechanical Engineering and M.S. Electrical Engineering. My master thesis involves the design and control of a mechatronics device that provides a versatile and cost-efficient way to re-orient small-part during autonomous robot assembly. This work was done in collaboration with [Mitsubishi Electric Research Lab](https://www.merl.com){:target="_blanck"}. A patent has been filed, and the thesis can be found [here](../files/Kong_MS_Thesis.pdf){:target="_blanck"}.
