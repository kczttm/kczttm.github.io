Hello! I'm a Robotics PhD student working with Prof. [Shreyas Kousik](https://www.shreyaskousik.com){:target="_blank"} in the [Safe Robotics Lab](https://saferoboticslab.me.gatech.edu/){:target-"_blank"} at Gatech. I'm interested in safe robot manipulations in critical scenerios or complex environments. 

Prior to joining Georgia Tech, I studied at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute where I obtained B.S. Mechanical Engineering (project advisor: Prof. [Sergio Pequito](https://www.spequito.com){:target="_blank"}) and M.S. Electrical Engineering (thesis advisor: Prof. [John T. Wen](https://john-wen.com){:target="_blank"}). My master thesis involves the design and control of a mechatronics device that provides a versatile and cost-efficient way to re-orient small-part during autonomous robot assembly line. This work was done in collaboration with [Mitsubishi Electric Research Lab](https://www.merl.com){:target="_blanck"}. A [patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20240261962A1/en){:target="_blank"} for this device was granted, and the thesis can be found [here](../files/Kong_MS_Thesis.pdf){:target="_blanck"}. 

Research Interest
======

Most robots, unlike human or animal,  Ordinary tasks such as washing dishes and handling food are challenging due to uncertainties that requires beyond commonly used vision.
